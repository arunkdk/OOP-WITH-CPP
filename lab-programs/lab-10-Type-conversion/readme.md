    <li>Make a class called memory with member data to represent bytes, kilobytes and megabytes. Read the value of memory in bytes from the user as basic types and display the result in user defined memory type. Like for m (basic type) = 108766, your program should display as: 1 megabyte 38 kilobytes 177 bytes.</li>
    <li>Write a program to convert total memory in bytes into mb, kb and bytes using type conversion. (1kb=1024bytes, 1mb=1024kb)</li>
    <li>Write a complete program to convert the polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates. (hint: polar-coordinates(radius, angle) and rectangular coordinates (x, y) where x = r*cos(angle) and y = r*sin(angle))</li>
    <li>Write a program to convert Rectangle coordinate to Polar coordinate by using:
        <ul>
            <li>conversion routine in source class</li>
            <li>conversion routine in destination class</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write a program to convert class Polar to Rectangle and vice versa by using type conversion.</li>
    <li>Write a program to convert degree Celsius to degree Fahrenheit by using class to class type conversion.</li>

<h1>Programs covered in lab-06:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Write a program to illustrate the dynamic memory allocation.</li>
    <li>WAP to find the sum of n numbers entered by user using Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++.</li>
    <li>Write a simple program using of dynamic memory allocation which should include calculation of 
        marks of 3 subjects of n students and displaying the result as pass or fail & name, roll. Pass 
        mark is 45 out of 100 in each subject.</li>
        <li>Write a program to add two complex numbers by using dynamic constructor.</li>
        <li>Using class write a program that receives inputs principle amount, time and rate. Keeping
             rate 8% as the default argument, calculate simple interest for three customers.</li>
             <li>WAP in C++ to calculate simple interest from given principal, time and rate. Set the
rate to 15 % as default argument when rate is not provided and also implement the
concept of dynamic initialization of object.</li>

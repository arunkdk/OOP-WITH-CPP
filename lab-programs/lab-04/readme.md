<h1>Programs covered in lab-04:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>WAP to create a single class with private data members and add them using friend function.</li>
    <li>WAP to add private data of two different classes using friend function.</li>
    <li>WAP to add private data of three different classes using friend function.</li>
    <li>Write a program to find the largest of four integers. your program should have three classes and each classes have one integer number.</li>
    <li>WAP to swap the contents of two variables of 2 different classes using friend function.</li>
    <li>WAP to add complex numbers of two different classes using friend class.</li>
    <li>Create classes called class1 and class2 with each of having one private member. Add member function to set a value(say setvalue()) one each class. Add one more function max() that is friendly to both classes. max() function should compare two private member of two classes and show maximum among them. Create one-one object of each class and then set a value on them. Display the maximum number among them.</li>

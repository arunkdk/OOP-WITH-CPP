<h2>Programs covered in Lab-03:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Write a program to find sum of two complex numbers by passing object as an argument.</li>
  <li>Write a program to find sum of two complex numbers by passing and returning object as an argument.</li>
  <li>Write a program to find sum of two complex numbers, function call by one object passing second object as function argument and return third object adding two objects. Hint: c3 = c1.addComplex(c2);</li>
  
  <li>
    Addition of two times with data members hours, minutes, and seconds:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>By passing object as an argument.</li>
      <li>By passing and returning object as an argument.</li>
      <li>Function call by one object, passing second object as function argument and returning third object.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Addition of two heights with data members feet and inches:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>By passing object as an argument.</li>
      <li>By passing and returning object as an argument.</li>
      <li>Function call by one object, passing second object as function argument and returning third object.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Create a new class named <strong>City</strong> that will have two member variables: <code>CityName[20]</code> and <code>DistFromKtm</code> (float). Add member functions to set and retrieve these values separately. Add a function <code>AddDistance</code> that takes two <code>City</code> objects and returns the sum of their <code>DistFromKtm</code>. In the <code>main()</code> function, initialize three <code>City</code> objects. Set the first and second to be Pokhara and Dhangadi. Display the sum of their distances using the third object’s <code>AddDistance</code> function.</li>

  <li>Create a class called <strong>Volume</strong> that uses three variables (length, width, height) of type distance (feet and inches) to model the volume of a room. Read the three dimensions, convert to fractional feet (e.g. 12 feet 6 inches = 12.5 feet), calculate the volume, and print it in cubic feet (ft³).</li>

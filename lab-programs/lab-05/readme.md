<h1>Programs covered in Lab-05:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Define a class to represent bowlers in a cricket team with data members name, Overs bowled, Runs given, Wickets taken and use constructor to initialize values and use member function to display bowlers information.</li>
        <li>Create a class called employee with data member Code, Name, address, salary. Create a constructor to initialize the member of the class. Also create the another constructor so that we can create an object from another object. Define member function display() to display the information of the class.</li>
        <li>Create a class time constructor having hour, minute and second as arguments is use to take two time data from user. The add function that takes two class objects as arguments add them respectively then display the aggregate result? (Apply 60 second =1 minutes and 60 minutes =1 hour)</li>
        <li>Create a class person with data members name, age, address and citizenship number. Write a constructor to initialize the value of a person. Assign citizenship number if the age of the person is greater than 16 otherwise assign zero to citizenship number. Also create a function to display values.</li>
        <li>Write a Program to add two complex number using the concept of Constructor overloading.</li>
        <li>Create a class Mountain with data members name, height, location, a constructor that initializes the members to the values passed it to its parameters, a function called CmpHeight() to compare two objects and DispInf() to display the information of mountain. In main create two objects of the class mountain and print the information of the mountain which is greatest height.</li>
    </ol>

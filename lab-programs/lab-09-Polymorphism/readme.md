<h1>Programs covered in lab-09:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Write a program finding area of square, rectangle, triangle by using function overloading technique.</li>
    <li>Write a simple program to overload unary minus(-) operator.</li>
    <li>Write a program to generate Fibonacci series using operator overloading of ++ operator.<br>
        OR<br>
        Write a simple program to overload ++ operator.</li>
    <li>WAP to add two complex numbers. Your program should have three objects. Each object contains two attributes (i.e. real and imaginary part) Now add each attribute and save them into third object separately. Use the concept of ‘+’ operator overloading.<br>
        OR<br>
        Write a program to overload + operator to add two complex number.</li>
    <li>Write a Program to find sum of two 3 X 3 matrix by overloading binary operator +.</li>
    <li>Write a Program to overload multiplication operator(*) showing the multiplication of two objects.</li>
    <li>Write a program to implement vector addition using operator overloading<br>
        i. Using Friend Function<br>
        ii. Without using Friend Function (using member function)</li>
    <li>Create a base class student. Use the class to store name, dob, rollno and includes the member function getdata(), discount(). Derive two classes PG and UG from student. Make dispresult() as virtual function in the derived class to suit the requirement.</li>
    <li>Create a abstract class shape with two members base and height, a member function for initialization and a pure virtual function to compute area(). Derive two specific classes, Triangle and Rectangle which override the function area(). Use these classes in main function and display the area of triangle and rectangle.</li>
    <li>We have a class name Complex which have data member real and imaginary. Default and parametrized constructor are there to initialize data member. Write a program to overloading unary operator ‘++’ where real and imaginary data member will be incremented and ‘+’ operator to add two complex number.</li>
